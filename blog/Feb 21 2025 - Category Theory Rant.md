In **Category Theory**, the following relation is **isomorphic** and not **identical**:      
**h . (g . f) = (h . g) . f** 

 This ***implies*** that there exists a **composition** that transforms the former category into 
 latter one and it is **not** the ***identity*** composition. 

**Corollary** to this idea is that two categories are **identical** if and only if one of them 
can be transformed into another **only through** the ***identity*** composition.

pretty cool right? never really thought about identity of an object to another through 
such a primitive lens!
